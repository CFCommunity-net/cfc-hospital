WP Hospital Database
============

WP Hospital Database is a WordPress plugins that provides a hospital database accessible for you to use inside WordPress. All hospitals are saved as a custom post type and can be used and extended in any way you see fit. 

For example:

- Let your users review hospitals
- Lets users search for hospitals
- Create a hospital directory 
- Integrate it with BuddyPress to link members to hospitals


### Why did we make this plugin?

WP Hospital Database is created for CFCommunity.net: A Social Network for people affected by Cystic Fibrosis (read more here: http://igg.me/at/cfcommunity/x). We integrated Hospitals into our community so people can see which other community members are a patient at their hospital and to provide a way for people to quickly find information about certain hospitals.
